# OVINTIV EHS: OPERATIONAL RISK ANALYSIS
BY: THOMAS NGUYEN

## Executive Summary 
This project delivers a data-focused assessment of operational safety risk by analyzing historical data containing real-time **Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) and H2S** exposure events captured from personal gas monitors across field operations. The objective of the analysis is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pilot gas-monitoring program before its broader rollout within the organization. By analyzing exposure events captured through personal gas monitors, the project supports safety management in understanding whether the pilot is leveraged successfully to identify operational facilities with elevated exposure risks and assess risks associated with common operational activities.

This project analyzes **historically recorded Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) exposure events** captured by real-time personal gas monitors to support a transition from **reactive safety response** to **proactive risk management**. While exposure alerts occur in real time, they are typically addressed after the fact through incident review. The purpose of this analysis is to learn from past events—identifying recurring patterns, high-risk tasks, and locations—to inform forward-looking safety decisions that reduce the likelihood and severity of future exposure events before they occur.


The purpose of the analysis is to shift safety management from reactive incident review toward **proactive risk identification**, enabling leadership to understand *where*, *when*, and *why* elevated exposure occurs. By translating raw sensor data into actionable insights, the project supports targeted interventions that improve worker safety, reduce incident frequency, and strengthen organizational risk governance.
