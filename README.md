# OVINTIV EHS: OPERATIONAL RISK ANALYSIS
BY: THOMAS NGUYEN

## Executive Summary 
This project delivers a data-driven assessment of operational safety risk by analyzing real-time **Lower Explosive Limit (LEL)** exposure events captured from personal gas monitors across field operations. The purpose of the analysis is to shift safety management from reactive incident review toward **proactive risk identification**, enabling leadership to understand *where*, *when*, and *why* elevated exposure occurs. By translating raw sensor data into actionable insights, the project supports targeted interventions that improve worker safety, reduce incident frequency, and strengthen organizational risk governance.

This project analyzes **historically recorded Lower Explosive Limit (LEL) exposure events** captured by real-time personal gas monitors to support a transition from **reactive safety response** to **proactive risk management**. While exposure alerts occur in real time, they are typically addressed after the fact through incident review. The purpose of this analysis is to learn from past events—identifying recurring patterns, high-risk tasks, and locations—to inform forward-looking safety decisions that reduce the likelihood and severity of future exposure events before they occur.
